# gshoes-app
GUIDE:

Before running this app, you must import database scripts first because this app is not deployed on heroku yet. I am sorry for your inconveniece.

Then, you should run BE by your IDE tools. This BE is written by Java.

Finally, you can run FE. This FE is written by ReactJS so to run this FE, open your terminal with the absolute directory of this FE and write command line "npm start" to run it.

Thank you and have a good day!
